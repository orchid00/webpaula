Handle your data the tidy way: an introduction to data science using R and some of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages

The use of R in the data science field has increased enormously the last few years. One very useful toolkit for a wide variety of analyses is the [‘tidyverse’](https://www.tidyverse.org/): a collection of R packages used for data manipulation, exploration and visualization that share a common design philosophy. 

Tidyverse packages are intended to make data analysis tasks more efficient. It gives a clear and readable structure to your analysis, resulting in reproducible work products.

In this workshop you will learn:

  - The difference between [tidy](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html) and untidy data
  - How to create [tidy](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html#sec:tidying) datasets and manipulate them using the main [tidyr](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) and [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) verbs
  - Make your results reproducible by using [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
  - Integrate data visualization into your workflow using [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
  - Use tidyverse functions to research biological problems


**LEVEL**: A [basic knowledge of the R programming language](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) is expected.

We expect a little bit of R-experience for this workshop. If you’re already an R-wizard but never did anything using tidyverse, then this workshop is a great introduction to it! If you’re not an R-wizard but know a little bit of R, then this workshop is a great way to improve your R skills quickly.
If you’re already pretty good with tidyverse, then we can not help you as this is an introductory workshop.

Please remember to bring your own laptop with the last version of R installed, instructions will be given to participants.
