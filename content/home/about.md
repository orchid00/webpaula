# Welcome! 

Hi I'm Paula, it is great to have you here. 

I am currently part of the Training Platform of [Elixir-Europe](https://www.elixir-europe.org/) as data science and bioinformatics trainer. My career interests include training, [R](https://www.r-project.org/), data analyis, and statistics. My goal as trainer is to help people make data and information [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples/). 

Research is now on wheels transitioning to openly accessible results. We might as well go on and improve our standards of accessibility. There are a few strategies that make our life easier when making our research accessible. Think about data management, annotation, datasets. Then think of a collaborative environment, for sharing and resharing.
